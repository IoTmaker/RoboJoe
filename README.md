# CoffeePro

This project uses the Huzzah, an ESP8266 based microcontroller from Adafruit, as the brains of a smart coffee maker.  Converted from a basic drip style electric coffee maker with only on/off functionality, the CoffeeMate coffee maker features wifi connectivity for remote control and monitoring so you can fire up a pot of joe from anywhere in your home and know how many cups remain.  It sports a LCD screen to display the temperature of your brew and when the pot was made.  

TODO:
