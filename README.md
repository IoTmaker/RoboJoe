# RoboJoe

This project uses the Huzzah, an ESP8266 based microcontroller from Adafruit, as the brains of a smart coffee maker.  Converted from a basic drip style electric coffee maker with only on/off functionality, the RoboJoe coffee maker features wifi connectivity for remote control and monitoring so you can fire up a pot of joe from anywhere in your home and know how many cups remain.  It sports a LCD screen to display the temperature of your brew and when the pot was made.  

TODO:
add timer functionality
serve the website - use cdn to get gifs and any styling - maybe github to host the website
send graphics and status to the frontend
use button to turn on off manually
use analog input pin A to get the fill level with capacitance sensor
make graphics to show on off, brewing and fill level, temp
get and use thermistor for temperature sensing
